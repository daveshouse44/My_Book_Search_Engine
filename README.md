# Book Search Engine

This search engine is built with Google Books API to find and save your favorite books! This app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The goal of this project is to refactor the app to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application is deployed to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
